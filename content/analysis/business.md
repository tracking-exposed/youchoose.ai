## Problem (summary slide, duplicate with content above)

There is a **growing frustration** on the monopolistic influence platforms have in shaping information flows.

**Content creators** are at the mercy of an opaque AI which favors engagement over quality.

**YouTube users** have their attention monetized and pushed towards addictive consumption patterns.

**Regulators** are demanding more AI transparency and market competition. 
- - -
We believe that **algorithmic platforms** like YouChoose will soon emerge, similar to how app stores offered alternatives to native applications.

YouChoose is an early **attempt to end the era of algorithmic monopolies**.

A step toward a **more open and decentralized internet**, with more user agency.

## Value Chain Positioning

**YouTube:** 

* [Adversarial Interoperability](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/10/adversarial-interoperability): we plug ourselves onto YouTube, without their approval
* [Context of antitrust scrutiny](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/18/google-antitrust-cases-in-us-and-europe-overview.html): we bet on the favourable legal and public opinion context to limit YouTube's aggressiveness 

---
**Content Creators:**
* Essential to our growth strategy so they promote YouChoose directly to their audience
* Content creators are like our first customers, who pay us with free advertisement

</section><section>

## Market Perspectives

[2.3 billions](https://www.oberlo.com/blog/youtube-statistics?utm_source=pocket_mylist) of YouTube users worldwide

Our target user segments: 

* Most **digitally literate users**, aware of the power of the algorithm and eager to customize it
* Users who speak **non-english languages** where recommendations are less relevant and less moderated
* **Heavy YouTube users**, who like to dig and browse content
* **Users frustrated** by YouTube's discretionary power to curate content

</section><section>

## Business Model

One of the features of YouChoose is to enable **recommendations outside of YouTube.com**

This has a highly lucrative potential: YouChoose will be a **gateway from YouTube** to other platforms, opposite to the typical dynamic.

This monetization scheme is both **politically aligned** with our internet decentralization mission and has **high lucrative potential**.
