## Context and  Motivation

**The recommendation algorithm is the gatekeeper of YouTube.**

Though, it is designed to maximize profits. Not to work for your best interest.

</section><section>

## YouChoose: the concept

**Gain back control over YouTube recommendations**

YouChoose is a recommendation module optimized for you, not for YouTube:

### ➜️ Users can choose the recommendation model that is best for them

### ➜️ Content Creator can choose the recommendations displayed on their own content.
---
It only requires a browser extension. Stay on YouTube.com, and watch content that is right for you.

## Problems solved for Content Creators

On YouTube, content creators are at the mercy of an **opaque AI, which creates a growing frustration.**

* Content Creators have no way to control the recommendations promoted on their channel. 
### ➜ YouChoose is a new way for Content Creators to connect with their audience, and to build referencing networks among them
---
* Often, the AI links their videos to content they don't associate with. But they have no way to know.
### ➜ YouChoose enables Content Creators to analyse what ads and recommendations are shown on their content

</section><section>


## Problems solved for users

Users have their **attention monetized** by the YouTube algorithm.

* Users are often promoted clickbaity, or attention-catching content tailored to their 
### ➜ Users can stay focus, and get the best recommendations relevant to the topic they are exploring.
---
* Users end-up locked into the YouTube ecosystem
### ➜ YouChoose features content from all around the web, not just YouTube.com


</section><section>


## Problems solved for researchers and regulators

**Regulators** are demanding more AI transparency and market competition. 

* There are no ways to obtain data to scrutinize the algorithm and inform upcoming legislation
### ➜ YouChoose lets users donate anonymised data about the algorithm's behavior, enabling independent research and oversight
---
* Current algorithmic monopolies prevent competition, as with native apps before the emergence of app-stores
### ➜ YouChoose is the first algorithmic platform, enabling third party to offer alternative recommendation systems

## Problem (summary slide, duplicate with content above)

There is a **growing frustration** on the monopolistic influence platforms have in shaping information flows.

**Content creators** are at the mercy of an opaque AI which favors engagement over quality.

**YouTube users** have their attention monetized and pushed towards addictive consumption patterns.

**Regulators** are demanding more AI transparency and market competition. 
- - -
We believe that **algorithmic platforms** like YouChoose will soon emerge, similar to how app stores offered alternatives to native applications.

YouChoose is an early **attempt to end the era of algorithmic monopolies**.

A step toward a **more open and decentralized internet**, with more user agency.

</section><section>

## Our approach

**YouChoose is an alternative recommendation system** for YouTube.

Rather than purely relying on AI, **YouChoose leverages human expertise** to identify the best related content. 

Such specialized human expertise is found among:
* Content creators (main feature)
* Volunteer contributors (Tournesol.app)
* Existing online communities (feeding recommendations from Reddit / RSS feeds)
* Users' personal feeds on other platforms (Facebook)
 
</section><section>

## Unique Value Proposition

**For YouTube users**:

* Recommendations that are aligned with your own interest, not someone else's profit. Choose who to trust.
* See the best related recommendations, stripped out of irrelevant, customized click-bait. 
* Make a political statement, demanding more agency over your internet experience, and the end of algorithmic monopolies. Liberate data for the public interest.
* Seeing recommendations outside of YouTube, including wikipedia pages, articles or links to other platforms.
* Super light habit change: Simple extension which overrides recommendations directly on YouTube.com.

---
**For content creators**:
* Gain back control on the other videos your content promotes.
* Gain a new direct connection to your audience, through recommendations.
* Get analytics on the recommendations and ads which YouTube puts on your content
* Find out if some of your videos are being shadow banned

## Future Developments: Fostering quality contributions from the community

In a second stage, it seems natural to also enable the community to curate recommendations.

For a given video, a user could suggest another a video or an external link that is relevant.

There needs to be incentive mechanisms to reward quality contributions, as curation is time-consuming. On the other hand, their needs to be safeguards to prevent spamming. 
One approach is to use a blockchain based coin. 

In order to make a content recommendation, users would need to stake some tokens. 
When the recommendation is downvoted by the community, the staked tokens are lost, and redistributed to the people whose recommendations have been upvoted.

## Competition

There is an existing market for extensions that improve the experience on YouTube.com. 

Most implement a targeted UX improvement, such as [ad-blockers](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adblock-for-youtube/cmedhionkhpnakcndndgjdbohmhepckk), [UI modifications](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/color-changer-for-youtube/nbgajjpkheaedahobdmhgkomjkpnnhfn) or [additional player controlers](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/magic-actions-for-youtube/abjcfabbhafbcdfjoecdgepllmpfceif). 

The only other actor with a similar intention of replacing YouTube recommendations is our partner [Tournesol.app](https://tournesol.app/) 

**Our real competitor is YouTube itself.** They added some [customizability features](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6342839?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid) to their algorithm over the past year. Twitter is

They might also attack us, by obfuscating their code to break our extension, removing it from the Google Store or through legal actions.

We are accounting for these scenarios in our design and strategy.

## Value Chain Positioning

**YouTube:**

* [Adversarial Interoperability](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/10/adversarial-interoperability): we plug ourselves onto YouTube, without their approval
* [Context of antitrust scrutiny](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/18/google-antitrust-cases-in-us-and-europe-overview.html): we bet on the favourable legal and public opinion context to limit YouTube's aggressiveness 

---
**Content Creators:**
* Essential to our growth strategy so they promote YouChoose directly to their audience
* Content creators are like our first customers, who pay us with free advertisement

</section><section>

## Market Perspectives

[2.3 billions](https://www.oberlo.com/blog/youtube-statistics?utm_source=pocket_mylist) of YouTube users worldwide

Our target user segments: 

* Most **digitally literate users**, aware of the power of the algorithm and eager to customize it
* Users who speak **non-english languages** where recommendations are less relevant and less moderated
* **Heavy YouTube users**, who like to dig and browse content
* **Users frustrated** by YouTube's discretionary power to curate content

</section><section>

## Business Model

One of the features of YouChoose is to enable **recommendations outside of YouTube.com**

This has a highly lucrative potential: YouChoose will be a **gateway from YouTube** to other platforms, opposite to the typical dynamic.

This monetization scheme is both **politically aligned** with our internet decentralization mission and has **high lucrative potential**.
