# H1

Humans are still smarter than AI.

Trust YouTubers over YouTube.

Take back control.

Content Creators are the (powerhouse - core - heart - bloodstream) of YouTube. They should be in charge. 

You love Your YouTubers? Put them in charge of recommendations on their own content.

Your favourite YouTubers could be your stewart.

Humans still know better than algorithms. 

Trust your YouTubers to recommend you the next video. They still know better than YouTube's AI.
