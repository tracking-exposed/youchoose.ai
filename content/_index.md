YouTube's recommendations is powerful. But it is not always working for your best interest: it's only purpose is to keep you watching.
   
But we think Humans are still smarter than AI so... why don't you let your favorite YouTubers recommend you what to watch next?

We empower internet users to control their recommendations because we trust YouTubers over YouTube and we want to take back control on reccomandations.
You love Your YouTubers? Put them in charge of recommendations on their own content.
