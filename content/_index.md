# Do you really get the best out of YouTube?

YouTube's AI is powerful. But it is not always working for your best interest.

It's only purpose is to keep you watching. And it might 

Let your favorite YouTubers recommend you what to watch next.

We empower internet users to control their recommendations.
 
Humans are still smarter than AI.

Trust YouTubers over YouTube.

Take back control.

Content Creators are the (powerhouse - core - heart - bloodstream) of YouTube. They should be in charge. 

You love Your YouTubers? Put them in charge of recommendations on their own content.

Your favourite YouTubers could be your stewart.

Humans still know better than algorithms. 

Trust your YouTubers to recommend you the next video. They still know better than YouTube's AI.
