<h2 class="titlehp" style="color:#e33180;"> [3/4] To allow content-creators to select their own recommendations, there are two systems we could build. 
The first options is to ask content creators to upload the <a style="color:#e33180"> links for recommendations in the video description,</a> which the extension can scrape directly. 
The second is to create a <a style="color:#e33180"> dedicated dashboard, </a> where content creators can log in to select their recommendations.
Which one seems more convenient to you?
