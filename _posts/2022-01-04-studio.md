If you are a Content Creator you may be wondering how to use our tools to recommend your audience exactly what you want. On the subdomain [studio/youchoose.ai][studio_url] you can link your channel to our system simply by <b>pasting your channel ID</b> and <b>publish in the channel description</b> the token you have generated. After the system verifies that you own that channel, you can remove the token from your channel description.

Once you link successfully your account, all your videos will be visible in the <b>LAB</b>, where you can copy-paste your recommendations for each video, change the order of appearence and edit their preview.
